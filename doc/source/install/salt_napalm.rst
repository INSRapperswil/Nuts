NAPALM and Salt
===============

To create a connection from the salt master to your network device of choice there's a fantastic library called NAPALM
which has an integration into SaltStack.
For the installation guide head over to the `napalm-salt repository <https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-salt/>`_.

A NAPALM minion-proxy is like a regular minion connected to the salt master. Every network vendor has it's on interface or
cli syntax. Even platforms from the same vendor can have different implementations. This makes life much harder for
a network automation engineer. This is where NAPALM comes in. NAPALM abstracts the different interfaces and enables
communication with a common interface. With NAPALM proxies it's possible to interact with network devices as if they were Linux boxes.
