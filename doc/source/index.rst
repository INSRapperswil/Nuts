Nuts is a network unit testing system, that automates tests in the network similar to unit tests you might know from programming.
The project uses SaltStack and napalm for the communication with the network devices. Normal Salt minions are used for Linux devices.
This project is currently under heavy construction and we can't guarantee you that this code works. But we do our best.
If you have any question, feature request or use cases please reach out to https://github.com/HSRNetwork/Nuts or join https://networktocode.slack.com/


How do you decide a network change was successful? Hopefully you have a test protocol and can do all the necessary test
on every touched box. When no test protocol is available you end up with jumping from device to device cli and
do some random pings and show command. For example, verifying if you BGP sessions are up and running. After that,
you will do maybe some pings from the client side. But are you confident you did no mistakes? Can you preempt side effects?
It’s 4 o’clock in the morning and you must decide if you can close the maintenance window or more tests are needed.

In a perfect world, the Network Engineer is sleeping well at 4 o’clock in the morning,
network automation is doing the approved change and if the change fails, a rollback is triggered.
On fail and success, a report is generated and the change is documented.
The network engineer is happy, network is happy and the customers are happy.
Engineers can do more engineering stuff and less operations.

For the perfect world, you must be able do decide whether a change was successful or not.
So, what is the definition of success? Of course, if the network is working as expected and the change has no side effects.
If we break DHCP in the VoIP subnet after a Firewall change, the phones will lose the connectivity after the lease is timed out.
If we not test DHCP explicit from this segment, we will not get notice about the issue before the first phone is disconnected.

To avoid side effects, software developer use since decades unit test and integration test.
Every feature gets his own tests and when someone adds a feature in the future, he can just run the test and
when all test passed, the old features should work as expected. Depending on the test quality.

So, let’s do the same in the network environment. Write some tests you can run (automatically) after a change to avoid side effects.
Like an automated test protocol and you will not forget to test anything.

Nuts supports different test involving network devices and/or Linux clients.

Network Engineers write the test in a easy readable YAML file. For example to test if you receive a virtual HSRP MAC address.

.. code:: yaml

 - name: example_arp
   command: arp
   devices: cisco.csr.1000v
   parameter: ['192.168.16.128']
   operator: '='
   expected: '00:0C:29:EA:D1:68'

Or you can use a raspberry pi with sub interfaces to test https from a specific segment:

.. code:: yaml

 - name: http_access_vlan_10
   command: webresponse
   devices: raspberry01
   parameter: ['https://github.com']
   operator: '='
   expected: True
   setup:
     - command: cmd.run
       parameter: ['ip route add 10.10.0.0/16 via 192.168.50.1 dev eth0.10']
       devices: raspberry01
   teardown:
     - command: cmd.run
       parameter: ['ip route del 10.10.0.0/16 via 192.168.50.1 dev eth0.10']
       devices: raspberry01

You can validate a test file first or just start the tests and wait for the result.
