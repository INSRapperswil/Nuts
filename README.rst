Nuts - Network Unit Testing System
##################################
Nuts is a network unit testing system, that automates tests in the network similar to unit tests you might know from programming.
The project uses saltstack and napalm for the communication with the network devices.
This project is currently under construction and we can't guarantee you that this code works.
If you have any question please reach out to mgabriel@hsr.ch or join https://networktocode.slack.com/

Installation of nuts
====================

The following Python versions are fully supported:

- Python 2.7

Pre-requirements
----------------
- Salt master
	Because nuts is fully based on saltstack you have to install and configure a salt master first.
	For the full installation guide please visit https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/installation/
- Salt api
	To use nuts you also need salt-api which enables nuts to connect to the salt master over Http. For the installation guide visit https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/netapi/all/salt.netapi.rest_cherrypy.html
- Napalm salt
	To create a connection from the salt master to your network device of choice there's a fantastic library called NAPALM which got an integration into saltstack. For the installation guide head to https://github.com/napalm-automation/napalm-salt

Install on arch linux
---------------------
TODO

Install on ubuntu
-----------------
TODO

Install with pip
----------------

The recommended way to install nuts is using `pip <http://pip.readthedocs.org/en/latest/>`_:

::

    $ sudo pip install -U nuts

This will automatically install the latest version from the `Python Package
Index <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/nuts/>`__.

Manual Installation
-------------------
TODO UPDATE

Get code::

    $ wget https://github.com/asta1992/nuts/archive/v0.3.0.zip
    $ unzip v0.3.0.zip
    $ cd nuts-1.0.0

Install::

    $ sudo python setup.py install

Usage
=======

usage: nuts.py [-h] [-i INPUT] [-v VALIDATE] [-its ITERATIONS]

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -i INPUT INPUT, --input INPUT INPUT
                        Validates the testfile and starts the tests afterwards
  -v VALIDATE, --validate VALIDATE
                        Validates a testfile
  -its ITERATIONS, --iterations ITERATIONS
                        Defines the maximum iterations that nuts waits for a response of saltstack

Testfiles
=========
The structure of the testfile has to be compliant with the testschema found in the folder nuts/src/service/testSchema.yaml.
An example could be:

- name: example_arp
  command: arp
  devices: cisco.csr.1000v
  parameter: [192.168.16.128]
  operator: '='
  expected: '00:0C:29:EA:D1:68'

Please note that the devices attribute gets directly passed to the salt master which determines the targeted minions with so called globbing. For more information what's globbing head to https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/targeting/globbing.html#globbing
If multiple minions are targeted each of them has to satisify the expected value for the test to pass.

The following commands are currently available with napalm-salt if this command is available on your device is also dependent on the availability of der underlying functions of napalm:
 - connectivity         - checks the connectivity to a certain IP address with a simple ping. Takes the target IP address as a parameter
 - traceroute           - checks the connectivity to a certain IP address with a traceroute. Takes the target IP address as a parameter
 - interfacestatus      - checks if a specific interface is available. Takes the interface name as a parameter
 - interfacespeed       - checks the speed of a specific interface. Takes the interface name as a parameter
 - arp                  - checks the mac address of a specific IP address. Takes the IP address as a parameter
 - checkversion         - checks the version of the device. Takes no parameter
 - checkuser            - checks which users are available on the device. Takes no parameter

For more information about the availability visit https://napalm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/support/index.html

The following commands are currently available for debian systems:
 - connectivity
 - traceroute
 - dnscheck
 - dhcpcheck
 - webresponse
 - portresponse

There are the following operators available:
 - =
 - <
 - >
 - not

Examples
========
There are a few more examples of test files available in the example folder.
